# Substrate

The Pontem network is Polkadot based, so it's built on [Substrate framework](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) and have connection to Relay Chain via Parathread technology.

## What is Substrate?

Substrate is a library of pre-built modules (called pallets) which allows anyone to **build their own custom blockchain**. Substrate's goal is to abstract away code-complexity by making available modular components which developers can use to build their custom blockchain.

## Why Substrate?

When the Polkadot team began building at Parity, they realized that **they were repeating a lot of development that had already been done** for the Ethereum and Bitcoin clients, such as writing RPC and database components. Even the most specialized blockchains have many attributes in common: a hashing algorithm, a database, networking, etc.

In order to **efficiently build many different blockchains**, Parity developers put all the functionalities needed to build a blockchain into a framework called Substrate. 

The idea was to take everything learned building Ethereum and Bitcoin implementations and make creating a blockchain as easy and flexible as possible. Substrate was created in a modular way to give technical freedom but also make functionalities like accounts, balances, governance, and smart contracts as easy as plugging in a library.

Substrateâ€™s multilayered architecture lets developers **choose between ease of development and technical freedom.** 

## What are the key components of the Pontem Substrate Architecture?

The Pontem network architecture combines several components to become a unique toolset to create, crowdsale and manage your blockchain projects, include DeFi ones.

To utilize the Pontem network the following components must first be implemented or already implemented:

* [Move VM runtime & pallet](../move_vm/README.md)
* [Compiler & Toolset](../move_vm/compiler_&_toolset.md)
* Parathread
* Validators
* Economic Model
* Governance

## Parathread

To fully implement the Pontem network we need to launch our own [Parathread](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parathreads). It is required as we want to have the Move VM pallet working, and No-Code tools working on top of Move language, and at same time having validators secure our Parathread.

## Validators

Validators will be rewarded in tokens for running and securing the Pontem network. 

## Governance

We implements official [gov pallet](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance).

## Financial Framework

Our financial framework is in the pre-alpha stage and includes the following smart contracts:

* Token contract
* Auction contract
* CDP contract

Source code is available in our [FF](https://github.com/pontem-network/contracts) smart contracts repo.
