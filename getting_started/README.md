# Getting Started

Here is a guide on how to connect to the Pontem network and execute your first transaction. We will move PONT coins from account to another account using Move language.

## Connection to network

To connect to the network you can use UI or CLI.

// TODO: testnet IP address.
Our testnet node deployed at the following IP address: ``. 
Use provided address to configure UI and CLI:

* [How to configure UI](./ui.md).
* [How to configure CLI](./cli.md).

If you want to test Pontem network locally, see our [local node](./local_node.md) build guide. 

## Tools

Also, to continue with the current guide you need to install a compiler & package manager calling `Dove`.

See Dove installation guide:

* [How to install Dove](./../move_vm/compiler_&_toolset.md#Dove)

After you installed Dove and configured UI/CLI let's move to the next step.
