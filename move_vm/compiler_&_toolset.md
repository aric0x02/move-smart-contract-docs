# Compiler & Toolset

We've developed a toolset for the Move VM and language which allows for:

* **Compiling** Move code into bytecode.
* **Testing** Move code with tests and formal verification.
* **Viewing** Move resources (stored data) from remote blockchain nodes.
* **Disassembling** Move binary and even read human readable result.
