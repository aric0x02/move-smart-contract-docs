# Use Cases

## Commercial-grade NFT instruments

The possibility of creating safe and secure smart contracts on Move allows for the creation of vastly superior NFTs which are more reflective of standard commercial documents and instruments which are common in the traditional finance world.

As a result of this, a number of manual commercial agreements and processes can be automated, resulting in a significantly lower cost of doing business.

A few projects such as [Centrifuge](https://medium.com/centrifuge/introducing-business-nfts-financial-business-documents-as-tokens-on-decentralized-networks-ec4b773f7ec5) and [NFTfi](https://nftfi.medium.com/the-nftfi-promissory-note-tokenizing-loans-as-nfts-erc721-e0dd9bbc7a8c) are also attempting to create these types of instruments, which highlights the growing maturity in the NFT space.

Examples of commercial-grade NFTs include:

* Commercial and large residential real estate titles
* Long term loan documents
* International trade agreements
* Shipping invoices and bills of lading
* Asset tracking in the agricultural and commodities sectors

## Pontem Blocks

No-code development platforms are various instruments that allow users to create software without **any prior knowledge** of programming languages.

This technology is believed to be the **future of development** since it helps users deploy software, build a business, and deliver web and mobile applications much faster than traditionally.

> ‚ÄúThe future of coding is no coding at all.‚Äù 
> ‚Äî Chris Wanstrath, CEO at GitHub.

We believe that DeFi is an excellent field to implement no-code development ideas because they will allow people to use the necessary tools in the blink of an eye and **save a lot of resources**. Moreover, external developers will be able to build their own Defi instruments and then share them as well.

Pontem Blocks is a tool that will enable creating smart contracts for different DeFi instruments with no coding skills required.

{% hint style="info" %}
üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Instead of writing code or spending resources on a development team, users will simply use drag-and-drop mechanics.
{% endhint %}

Thus, they will be able to use different Defi instrument actions in one pla—Åe, _for instance, swap tokens, provide liquidity, and stake LP tokens, all in one transaction_. Use presets and even ready-to-use actions made by external developers.

{% hint style="info" %}
üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The aforementioned functions are just examples of the upcoming functionality of the platform. 

The Pontem Network reserves the right to change, add, or adjust these or any other functions.
{% endhint %}

Additionally, our upcoming platform planned to have an entire section of ready-to-use Presets ‚Äî prospective strategies with an estimated annual yield that you‚Äôll be able to use for your projects.

We believe that Pontem Blocks will become one of the convenient no-code DeFi tools that you will use on a daily basis.
